Hello there!	

 My name is Michael Angelo Cantara.	

 I am a person that really like to play video games, watch anime, read manga, and experiment with things that I do not understand. Just like making this blog.	

 I started this blog as a place to express my thoughts and ideas in a more written form. I hope that you enjoy some of the things that I write about, such as anime, gaming, poem. short stories, random interesting topics, personal thoughts, and my weekly update in my game development journey.
