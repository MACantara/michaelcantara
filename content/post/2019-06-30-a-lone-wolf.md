---
There was a lone wolf last night. That wolf travel from place to place to find a home. From what people has said, that wolf has a name. That name was Mazu. Mazu was found in an abandoned house not long ago by a particular person. That person was a lovely little girl named Snow. She found the little wolf and took care of him as a pet. She named him Mazu from the name of a friend that she knew very closely that unfortunately passed away.



Snow carried Mazu on her way from playing with her friends.

Snow showed love and care for Mazu as not only as a pet but also as family.



And thus the two went on to have joy and memories together.
