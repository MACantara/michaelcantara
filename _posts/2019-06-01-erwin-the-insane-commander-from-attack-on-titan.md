This character is freaking insane. He does not care what happens to him to just advance to his dream. Like that one scene when Erwin and the Survey Corps was planning to rescue Eren. After having his usual empowering speech to his men, he commanded to advance to the objective. And after that, a titan appeared from nowhere bitting the right arm of Erwin. It was pretty devasting to lose that arm. But he still orderd the rest of Survey Corps to rescue Eren. It is one amazing and shocking scene. That is the very definition of insanity.

I am also watching Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 as the moment. I am loving it. This is the part of the story when we are going to see Erwin die (Spoliers!).

That's all for my thoughts about Erwin.

Thanks for reading!
