      <description>Hello there!
My name is Michael Angelo Cantara.
I am a person that really like to play video games, watch anime, read manga, and experiment with things that I do not understand. Just like making this blog.
I started this blog as a place to express my thoughts and ideas in a more written form. I hope that you enjoy some of the things that I write about, such as anime, gaming, poem.</description>
